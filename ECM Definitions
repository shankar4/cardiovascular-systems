* _Development_ - genetically programmed and adaptive processes through which a fertilized egg becomes a mature organism; these processes
involve changes in mass, local structure, and properties and can result in either  normal or abnormal tissue. 
* _Maintenance_ - normal programmed or adaptive processes during maturity that consist of a balanced turnover of cells and extracellular 
matrix at an unchanging configuration or subset of configuations; hence, there is no net change in mass, structure, or properties. 
* _Aging_ - gradual changes in structure, properties, and/or mass that follow maturation and are independent of disease or injury but
nevertheless lead to an increasing probability of death. 
* _Healing_ - changes in mass, structure, and/or properties in response to disease or injury that serve to restore function or at least to
arrest the extent of damage.
