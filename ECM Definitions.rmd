From "A constrained mixture model for growth and remodeling of soft tissues" by J. D. Humphrey and K.R. Rajagopal, Mathematical Modeling

* *Development* - genetically programmed and adaptive processes through which a fertilized egg becomes a mature organism; these processes
involve changes in mass, local structure, and properties and can result in either  normal or abnormal tissue. 
* _Maintenance_ - normal programmed or adaptive processes during maturity that consist of a balanced turnover of cells and extracellular 
matrix at an unchanging configuration or subset of configuations; hence, there is no net change in mass, structure, or properties. 
*  _Aging_ - gradual changes in structure, properties, and/or mass that follow maturation and are independent of disease or injury but
nevertheless lead to an increasing probability of death. 
* _Healing_ - changes in mass, structure, and/or properties in response to disease or injury that serve to restore function or at least to
arrest the extent of damage. 

The means for these processes are as follows:
* *Growth* - an increase in mass that is achieved locally via an increase in the number (e.g., via proliferation, hyperplasis, or migration) or size (hypertrophy) of cells and/or via a synthesis of extracellular matrix that exceeds removal; growth may or may not change the mass density or material properties. 
* _Atrophy_ -  a decrease in mass that is achieved locally via cell death (necrosis or increased apoptosis) or cell migration, and/or a degradation of intracellular components or extracellular matrix that exceeds synthesis; for this reason,, atrophy can be thought of as "negative growth" and it is often not mentioned explicitly. 
* *Remodeling* - a change in structure (intracellular, cellular, or extracellular) that is achieved by reorganizing existing constituents (e.g., altered orientation or cross-linking) or by synthesizing new consituens that have a different organization; remodeling may or may not alter the mass density, but it does change other material properties such as stiffness or symmetry. 

The authors also define adapation as follows: 
* *Adaptation* - any acute or chronic change in the state, properties, structure, or mass of a molecule, cell, tissue, organ, or organism that is in response to a change in environment. Adaptation may occur via the process of growth and remodeling as well as via changes in vasoactivity, hydration level, etc.
