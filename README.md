Early and Noninvasive Diagnostics
I have several US patents on early and noninvasive detection of atherosclerosis, the cause behind heart attacks and strokes. It is my goal to refine my earlier method to build a simple and low cost system for providing relevant health care alerts sufficiently ahead of time to prevent adverse events.
As a first step, I will gain familiarity with the physionet databases ('PhysioBank') available here: https://www.physionet.org/physiobank/about.shtml . Linux installation instructions for their open source software are provided here: https://www.physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb-linux-quick-start.shtml . Here is a reference paper on the database and toolkit: http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/101/23/e215.full . I have installed their software on my Ubuntu system. Need to read their manuals.
