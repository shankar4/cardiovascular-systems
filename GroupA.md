This grouping is from the chapter by McLeon, Mecham, et al., on "Extracellular matrix gene expression in the developing mouse aorta" 
in a book entitled "Extracellular Matrix in Development and Disease" edited by J.H. Miner, Elsevier, 2005.

Note: Elseview publishes a journal called: Matrix Biology (of relevance here). 

Ontology annotations of the Gene Ontology Database are used in the grouping. The GO database has three ontologies that take 3 
different perspecives: molecular function (**MF**) (tasks performed by individual gene products); biological process (**BP**) (broad biological goals that are assembled by ordered assemblies of molecular functions); and cellular components (**CC**) (subcellular structures, locations, and macromolecular complexes). The genes listed include ECM genes, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and related genes, growth factors, signal transduction genes, genes identified as SMC markers and endothelial cell markers.

Group A is the largest functional group. Expression is above baseline level during the embryonic phase and go below baseline during the adult period. BP perspective: genes involved in regulation of transcription, development, transport, phosphorylation, and cell adhesion. Others are: signal transduction, cell signaling, cell cycle, and cell growth. 

The authors list mouse genes; my focus here is human genes. So, I have downloaded papers relevant to the human sequence. To start with, here are the major categories of genes. Ref used is listed next to each.

Cadherins (From Wikipedia): Cell adhesion molecule (CAM) that is important ...to bind cells with each other. Cadherins are a class of type-1 transmembrane proteins, dependent on calcium (Ca2+) ions to function. <br><br>

Catenins: The protein encoded constitute adherens junctions (AJs). AJs are necessary for the creation and maintenance of epithelial cell layers by regulating cell growth and adhesion between cells. The encoded protein also anchors the actin cytoskeleton and may be responsible for transmitting the contact inhibition signal that causes cells to stop dividing once the epithelial sheet is complete. Mutations of the APC gene (Catenins bind to APC gene products) are a cause of colorectal cancer (CRC), pilomatrixoma (PTR), medulloblastoma (MDB), and ovarian cancer. 

Ephrin: Gene ephrin A1 encodes a member of the ephrin (EPH) family. The ephrins and EPH-related receptors comprise the largest subfamily of receptor protein-tyrosine kinases and have been implicated in mediating developmental events, especially in the nervous system and in erythropoiesis. 

FGFs (from Wiki): FGFs are multifunctional proteins with a wide variety of effects; they are most commonly mitogens but also have regulatory, morphological, and endocrine effects. They stimulate blood vessel growth, and are important in wound healing. <br><br>
Fibronectin: (From Wiki) -  Fibronectin is a high-molecular weight (~440kDa) glycoprotein of the extracellular matrix that binds to membrane-spanning receptor proteins called integrins. Similar to integrins, fibronectin binds extracellular matrix components such as collagen, fibrin, and heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Dysregulation of the FGF signalling system underlies a range of diseases, where inhibitors of FGF signalling have shown clinical efficacy. <br><br>

Laminins: They form high-molecular weight (~400 to ~900 kDa) proteins of the extracellular matrix. They are involved in the pathology of a number of organs, including skin, muscle, and nerve. In muscle cells, laminin alpha 2 is a component of the bridge that links the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. In patients with laminin alpha 2 mutations, the bridge is disrupted and mature muscle cells apoptose. Congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) results.
